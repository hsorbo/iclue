## About
I’m an apple OS X user and CLUE doesn’t run on OS X, that was my motivation for writing this program.

> :warning: **This repo will not compile as the the source for reading the dicts is kept private**

## Download
[macOS 10.15](https://github.com/hsorbo/iclue/releases/download/v0.14/iClue_0.14.dmg),
[OS X 10.5+](http://static.hsorbo.no/iclue/iClue_0.13.dmg),
[OS X 10.4](http://static.hsorbo.no/iclue/iClue_0.8a.dmg)

## Installation
READ the Limitations!
Download the dmg, drag iClue into your Applications folder (same old, same old).
You’ll need to have access to or copy of an installed version on windows.
Open preferences and in the dictionary-pane hit the +
Add the idx-files
If you are lucky things will work.

## Limitations / bugs
No concatenation of multiple definitions. They will appear as duplicate keywords with different definitions.
No jump to synonyms. »foo means that you should search for foo instead.
No line wrapping.
Some search issues.
